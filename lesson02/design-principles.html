            <h1>Visual Hierarchy</h1>
            <h2>Embers Adrift</h2>
            <a href="https://www.embersadrift.com">embersadrift.com</a>
            <div class="lesson-2-img-container">

            </div>
            <p>The use of visual hierarchy is apparent in the order of elements: their logo (most important point of
                recognition for a brand), the official trailer (an immediate CTA to acquire new customers), a welcome
                message, and finally a CAT to join as a customer, having been enticed by all of the above elements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h1>Proximity</h1>
            <h2>Starbucks</h2>
            <a href="https://www.starbucks.com">starbucks.com</a>
            <div class="lesson-2-img-container">
                <img class="lesson-2-img" src="images/starbucks.png" alt="Starbucks website screenshot">
            </div>
            <p>There seems to be overlap (ironically) between proximity and whitespace. Starbucks uses both wisely,
                through their spacing between the image, the primary message, the description, and the CAT button,
                "Order now." The spacing between all of these elements appears identical, but they are all closer to
                each other than any other elements. The lack of proximity and the whitespace surrounding the CTA button,
                make it stand apart, undistracted by any surrounding clutter.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h1>Repetition</h1>
            <h2>Stance</h2>
            <a href="https://www.stance.com">stance.com</a>
            <div class="lesson-2-img-container">
                <img class="lesson-2-img" src="images/stance.png" alt="Stance website screenshot">
            </div>
            <p>As is likely seen in many retail websites, Stance uses a carousel to display their products. While they
                only show two products and the carousel arrows, we are lead to believe that all of the products in this
                carousel are variations of their snowboarding socks. The products are presented in an identical size and
                manner. Even though it is only repeated one time, we immediately understand that it will be repeated
                many more.</p>
